                <br><br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a student at San Francisco State University, currently pursuing a 
                Bachelor’s degree in Visual Communication along with a minor in Comic Studies. She transferred there
                from West Valley College where she spent three years there after graduating from Lynbrook High School.
                She is passionate about arts and crafts and even owns her own Etsy shop, where she has already made 
                hundreds of sales there. Ever since middle school, she has always loved being creative and knew she 
                wanted to pursue a career related to the arts. Eventually, she decided to learn how to design digitally 
                due to the technological advancements of today. Right now, she is working on acquiring all of the 
                necessary GPA points for Visual Communication, and once she is done with that, she’ll work on her Comic 
                Studies. Her biggest dream is to make her own superhero comics, like Stan Lee. Right now, she is honing 
                her drawing skills and researching on how to make comics. She has already made up quite a few superheroes 
                and villains, such as Majestic Girl and the Collector, so now she has to learn how to actually make the 
                comics. She has a solid foundation in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign, and is currently learning to 
                draw on an app on her iPad called ibisPaint X after it was recommended to her by someone she met in the
                Comics Club at San Francisco State University. Though she loves arts and crafts, most of her creative 
                activities in the past have been making pendant necklaces, fashion accessories and customizing 
                Littlest Pet Shop toys, therefore drawing is a skill she is still honing as of now.  </p>
